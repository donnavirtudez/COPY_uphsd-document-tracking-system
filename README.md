### Branch Naming Guidelines

You may use any of these patterns depending on the type of work:

- `feat/feature-name`       → For new features
- `fix/bug-description`     → For bug fixes
- `chore/maintenance-task`  → For non-feature cleanup, updates
- `docs/documentation-task` → For documentation only
- `hotfix/urgent-fix`       → For emergency production fixes
- `refactor/code-change`    → For refactoring work

**Examples:**
- `feat/document-tracking-ui`
- `fix/missing-status-update`
- `docs/update-api-docs`
- `chore/update-eslint`
- `hotfix/urgent-fix-500-error`
- `refactor/cleanup-legacy-code`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
